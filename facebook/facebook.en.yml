    This page supports the teachings of the Electronic Bible Fellowship.  
    We believe in interpreting the Bible by comparing scripture with scripture (1 Corinthians 2:13). 
    We have no relationship or affiliation with any church or denomination.

    (1 Corinthians 9:24) Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.
    (Hebrews 12:1-2) Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.
